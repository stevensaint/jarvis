    A CLI on a monthly seat is quoted at what the same work would have cost

    becomes several — so the daily ledger and the day report behind it
    counted the same day differently (113 vs 204 calls, 2026-08-25). Reading
    always at the finest grain the section ever draws keeps every count the
