"""FastAPI + WebSocket server for the desktop UI (Phase 1a).

Responsibilities:
- REST endpoints for health, config read-only, plugin discovery, debug.
- WebSocket `/ws` with welcome frame, bus forwarding, input validation.
- Optional static mount for the React build under `dist/` (production mode).

Explicitly NOT here:
- Channel-adapter logic (in `jarvis/channels/web.py`).
- The React build itself (Agent 5).
- Single-instance focus logic (only a placeholder endpoint).
