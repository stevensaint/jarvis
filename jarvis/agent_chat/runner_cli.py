"""CLI-backed turns — a vendor agent binary drives the session.

Every coding CLI the Agentic IDE registers (``jarvis.workspace.agents``)
has a planner here, so the chat's picker offers the same CLIs a pane does
(maintainer, 2026-08-27: the CLIs connected in the Agentic IDE, and each
one drawn as a chat, never as a terminal). Nine entries, seven wire shapes:

* **Claude-shaped NDJSON** — ``claude`` (Claude Code), ``grok`` (Grok
  Build, whose ``--output-format streaming-messages-json`` is the Anthropic
  Messages wire shape on purpose) and GLM Coding Plan, which IS Claude Code
  pointed at Z.ai's endpoint through the registry's environment factory.
  One translator turns their ``system`` / ``stream_event`` / ``assistant`` /
  ``user`` / ``result`` lines into agent-chat events.
* **Codex NDJSON** — ``codex exec --json`` with ``thread.*`` / ``turn.*`` /
  ``item.*`` lines.
* **Antigravity NDJSON** — ``agy --output-format stream-json`` with
  ``event: init | step_update | result`` lines (``step_update`` carries text
  deltas and tool steps keyed by ``step_index``; verified against agy 1.1.19).
* **OpenCode NDJSON** — ``opencode run --format json`` with ``step_start`` /
  ``text`` / ``reasoning`` / ``tool_use`` / ``step_finish`` / ``error``
  lines, each wrapping one ``part`` of the session record and naming the
  session on every line (verified against opencode 1.18.23).
* **Kimi NDJSON** — ``kimi -p --output-format stream-json`` writes chat
  messages by ``role``: an ``assistant`` line with its text and
  ``tool_calls`` (OpenAI's function-call shape, arguments as a JSON string)
  and a ``tool`` line per result. Nothing streams and nothing names the
  session, so the id is found afterwards in Kimi's own session store
  (``agentic_ide.agent_sessions``), the way a pane finds its own
  (verified against kimi-code 0.29.2).
* **Plain text** — ``dsh --profile headless`` (DeepSeek Harness) prints the
  final message and exits: no tool stream, no session, one answer.
* **Cursor stream-json** — ``agent -p --output-format stream-json`` with
  ``system`` / ``assistant`` / ``tool_call`` / ``result`` lines (Cursor's
  documented print-mode wire; session id on every line).

Every CLI that keeps a conversation resumes it natively (``claude --resume``,
``codex exec resume``, ``grok -r``, ``agy --conversation``, ``opencode run
--session``, ``kimi --session``, ``agent --resume``), so the session row keeps the vendor's id
in ``vendor_session`` and a later turn continues the same conversation — the
tools, skills, MCP servers and permissions are the CLI's own, exactly as in
a terminal. The person's permission mode maps onto the closest stance each
CLI offers. A print-mode CLI cannot ask back: Claude answers permission
prompts over stdin; Codex has ``--approve-for-me``. agy 1.1.26 instead
soft-denies the tool and **exits**, so the chat shows ``run_command - failed``
and goes idle with no answer — ``accept-edits`` therefore also passes
``--dangerously-skip-permissions`` (the same flag the mission worker has
used since 2026-06). Jarvis tools reached over MCP still go through
:class:`~jarvis.core.protocols.SupervisorToolGateway`.

Spawning follows the mission workers: shell-free argv, the prompt on stdin
where the binary accepts it, ``NO_WINDOW_CREATIONFLAGS``, UTF-8 decoding,
and the agent-account environment (``jarvis.agent_accounts.spawn_env``) so
the active subscription seat is the one that answers.
