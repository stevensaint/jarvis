    # 4.7.1 + torch 2.11-cu128): 40/40 inferences under in-process torch-OpenMP
    # load, zero hangs, p50 117 ms — the hang was constellation-specific, not

    harness (accepts the legacy ``[harness.openclaw]`` alias, see below).

    ⚠️ INERT TODAY (2026-06-28): Jarvis-Agent is NOT a registered harness —
    there is no ``jarvis_agent`` (formerly ``openclaw``) entry-point in
    pyproject.toml (Welle-4 removed the subprocess
    worker, ~92% hang; see docs/BUGS.md). This block is a Wave-2 schema stub:
    setting ``enabled = true`` has NO effect — the harness cannot be dispatched
    and "start a subagent" routes to ``spawn_worker`` regardless. The boot path
    logs a warning when ``enabled`` is true but the harness is unregistered
    (see ``warn_if_phantom_worker_harness`` in jarvis/brain/factory.py). Heavy
    sub-agent work runs through the Mission-Manager (ClaudeDirectWorker), not
    here, until Wave 3 actually wires the bridge.

    Schema matches ``docs/jarvis-agents-bridge.md §4.2`` post-Wave-1
    (with AD-22..AD-24 findings incorporated). Wave 2 delivers only
    the schema + default block in jarvis.toml; Wave 3 wires the bridge.

    Deliberately NO Anthropic lock in the ``model`` default: an empty ``model``
    means the bridge resolves the frontier-pro of the active Personal Jarvis
    provider (``cfg.brain.primary``) via the provider-slug mapping from AD-6
    (gemini→google/gemini-..., claude-api→anthropic/..., openai→openai/...).
    This way Jarvis-Agent automatically follows the user's provider choice.

    AD-21 pin-version mandate: ``version`` must be set whenever the block
    exists at all — a Pydantic required field, no default. Guards against
    silent upstream drifts. Loading without the block (``HarnessConfig.
    jarvis_agent is None``) falls back to "bridge inactive".

    Like Telegram, Discord is a *communication channel*: a user messages the
    bot (DM or a guild channel) and the message is forwarded into the normal
    Jarvis chat path — chatting with the bot is the same as prompting Jarvis.

    The bot token lives in the Credential Manager (key ``discord_bot_token``,
    ENV fallback ``DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN``) — never in this config file.

    Setup steps for the user:
      1. Create an application + bot at https://discord.com/developers/applications.
      2. Enable the **Message Content Intent** (Bot → Privileged Gateway
         Intents) — without it the bot cannot read message text.
      3. ``python -m jarvis --wizard`` — stores the bot token in the
         Credential Manager.
      4. Invite the bot to a server, or open a DM with it.
      5. Set ``enabled = true`` in this config.

    Security default: ``allowed_user_ids = []`` with ``guild_policy =
    "allowlist"`` means the bot replies to nothing until you explicitly allow a
    user id or channel id. ``pair_on_first_dm`` claims the empty allowlist for
    the first direct-message sender so the common "invite + DM" setup is not
    silently dropped.

    # that pass a no-op rather than a loss: on a timeout, an error, a missing
    # key or a failed drift guard the raw transcript is what gets delivered,
    # and the raw text stays on the history row either way.

    #: Master switch, and it ships ON. That is safe on a fresh clone with no
    #: credentials at all, which is the whole point: ``polish_provider =
    #: "auto"`` resolves through the key-aware, family-crossing chain, and
    #: that chain comes back EMPTY when the user holds no text-model key in
    #: any family. Such an install reports ``unavailable`` and delivers

    polish_model: str = ""

    #: Hard wall-clock ceiling for the whole pass, in milliseconds. It runs

    #: The key above is a promise about the wait; the work it bounds is sized
    #: by the user, because the model has to write the finished text out. One
    #: fixed ceiling therefore switches the pass off on exactly the dictations
    #: that need it most. Measured on one live install (2026-08-20, 201 wording
    #: passes at the 1200 ms ceiling): successful passes ran 526 ms median
    #: below 25 words and 850-1000 ms at 100-220 words, while the 20 that
    #: expired had a median of 77 words against 15 for the ones that came back.
    #: A tenth of the pass was being thrown away by the clock, and it was the
    #: long half.
    #:
    #: So the budget ramps: unchanged up to ~25 words, and a few milliseconds
    #: per further word after that, never past this ceiling. The allowance is
    #: that small because the same measurement shows the wall is met far
    #: earlier than "long dictation" suggests — the p90 at 25-49 words was
    #: already 992 ms.
    #:
    #: **A wider ceiling does not make dictation slower.** The model answers
    #: when it answers; this number is only reached when the provider is
    #: struggling, and there the choice is between waiting an extra second and
    #: dropping the wrong language into a live document.

    #: and get the old fixed ceiling back.

    #: already caught per-transcript by the word-ratio band and the number and
    #: protected-term checks, and the cost of a long input is measured in

    #: pass on exactly the dictations that need it most — four minutes of
    #: speech is roughly where a transcript stops being one sentence and starts
    #: being something the recognizer has broken into paragraphs at arbitrary

    #:
    #: Ships OFF, and the reason is cost rather than safety: a dictation is a

#: same file parsed in 8 ms in a fresh process. The window title said
#: "Not responding" and keystrokes typed into an Agentic-IDE pane arrived

def ensure_project_root_cwd() -> Path:
    """Pin the process working directory to the project root. Returns the CWD.

    Several persistence paths are resolved relative to ``os.getcwd()`` under the
    historical assumption that the desktop app always launches from the repo
    root — the onboarding state file (``data/setup_state.json``), the SQLite DBs
    (chats / sessions / missions / friends / jarvis), the flight recorder, and
    the self-mod / review audit logs. That assumption is false in practice: the
    autostart Scheduled Task sets a WorkingDirectory, but a manual start or an
    in-app restart inherits the user home (observed live CWD: ``C:\\Users\\<user>``).
    The same install then read/wrote a *different* ``data/`` dir per start method
    — re-showing the first-run setup guide on every restart and splitting the
    user's Chats/Sessions/Missions across two folders.

    It also pins the repo root onto ``sys.path``. ``python -m`` seeds
    ``sys.path[0]`` from the *start-time* cwd, and a later ``os.chdir`` does NOT
    patch the import path. A start from a foreign cwd (manual launch / an in-app
    restart inheriting the user home) therefore left the repo root off
    ``sys.path``, so the ROOT packages ``ui`` and ``conductor`` — which live
    outside the editable-installed ``jarvis`` package — failed to import
    ("No module named 'ui'"), silently disabling the on-screen overlay
    (jarvis-bar) and the Conductor view. Putting the root on the path makes
    those imports resolve regardless of how the process was started.

    Call this once, as early as possible in every process entry point (before
    ``load_config`` and before the server touches any ``data/`` path). It is
    idempotent and never raises: a chdir failure is logged and the process
    continues with whatever CWD it had.
