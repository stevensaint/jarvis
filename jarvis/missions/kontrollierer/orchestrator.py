"""Kontrollierer.Orchestrator — THE HEART of Phase 6.

Wires together:
- MissionDecomposer -> MissionPlan (1..5 Steps)
- WorkerProtocol-Factory -> spawn per step in the worktree
- CriticRunner -> verdict per worker iteration
- ReflectionMemory -> episodic memory between iterations
- BudgetTracker -> cost discipline
- MissionManager -> state-machine transitions

Concurrency:
- `asyncio.TaskGroup` (Python 3.11+) + `asyncio.Semaphore(MAX_WORKERS)` —
  each step coroutine wraps try/except so that a single failing task does not
  trigger a full TaskGroup cancellation.
- State-machine transitions are serialised via `_state_lock` per mission so
  that parallel tasks do not interfere with each other.

State-machine model (simplified for MVP):
- Mission state: PENDING -> RUNNING -> CRITIQUING -> APPROVED|FAILED.
- Per-task iteration is tracked internally (not via the state machine); the
  mission-level state only reflects the coarse lifecycle.

    def _capture_diff(self, worktree: Path) -> str:
        """Returns the worker's changes as a unified diff.

        Plain `git diff HEAD` only shows MODIFIED tracked files — it misses
        the worker's freshly created files (e.g. a new hello.py), which is
        exactly the most common task shape. We stage everything with
        `git add -A .` (real, full-content blobs) so new files appear as
        empty→content adds in `git diff HEAD`. The staging is confined to
        the throwaway per-task worktree (no commit, reset at cleanup).

        BUG-DIFF-EMPTY (2026-05-24): the previous `git add -N .`
        (intent-to-add) was a soft marker that registered new files with an
        EMPTY index blob AND removed them from `git ls-files --others`.
        On Windows git, `git diff HEAD` did not render the intent-to-add
        content, so a freshly-written file fell through BOTH detection
        paths → empty diff → the Critic deterministically returned
        "revise" → critic_loop_exhausted even though the worker had
        written the file correctly (live repro mission_019e5a0f, 3 empty
        iterations despite a real Write tool-call). Switching to `add -A`
        stages full blobs so `git diff HEAD` shows new files reliably.

        As a belt-and-braces guard we still enumerate `git ls-files
        --others --exclude-standard` and append any paths missed by the
        diff as comment lines (`# untracked-not-in-diff: …`). The Critic
        prompt reads the diff as text, so comment-prefixed lines are
        informational and don't require a parser change.

        Committed-deliverable capture (2026-07-03, mission 019f26d0-bb07): when
        the worktree records a BASE commit SHA (``read_worktree_base_sha``), we
        diff the index against that BASE rather than the live ``HEAD``. A worker
        that ``git commit``s its file advances ``HEAD`` past the deliverable, so
        ``git diff --cached HEAD`` renders EMPTY for it and the file is lost;
        diffing against the fork-point base surfaces committed AND uncommitted
        changes alike. Falls back to ``HEAD`` when no base was recorded (older /
        externally-created worktrees), so this is purely additive.

        All git calls are best-effort with a 10s cap; failure returns ""
        and logs at WARNING so the upstream Critic still gets a
        (truthful) empty diff rather than a stale one.
