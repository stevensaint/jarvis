"""Phase-6 Bootstrap — wires all mission components at app startup.

Called by ``jarvis/ui/web/server.py::start()`` (or a standalone CLI).
Returns a dict with all instantiated components that the caller can store
in ``app.state.<key>``.

Startup order per plan §"Block D":
1. cleanup.startup_sweep
2. MissionManager + start (Recovery)
3. BudgetTracker (with emitter -> store.append_and_publish)
4. WorktreeManager (driven by cfg)
5. CriticRunner
6. MissionDecomposer (optional brain)
7. Kontrollierer (wires everything + safety_enabled)
8. ConnectionManager-Bus-Bridge — already done in Phase-4 server.py
9. MissionVoiceListener (when TTS is available)
10. daily_cleanup_task (when config.daily=true)

Each step is optional via a cfg flag. Default values come from jarvis.toml
[phase6.*] (see the section defaults there).
