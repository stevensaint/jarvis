"""CodexDirectWorker -- drives `codex exec` directly via ChatGPT-OAuth.

Welle 6 (2026-05-18): user switched from Claude Max subscription to
ChatGPT subscription as the canonical worker backend. The ``codex`` CLI
(OpenAI's official agent CLI) supports the same OAuth-bearer flow as
``claude``: ``codex login`` stores the access/refresh tokens in
``~/.codex/auth.json`` and every subsequent ``codex exec`` invocation
picks them up automatically -- no API key required.

This worker mirrors :class:`ClaudeDirectWorker` but adapts to Codex's
event format (``thread.started`` / ``turn.started`` / ``item.completed``
/ ``turn.completed`` JSONL frames instead of Anthropic's
``system`` / ``assistant`` / ``result`` shape). Translates the Codex
events into the WorkerProtocol's Claude-shaped events so the
Kontrollierer/Critic loop does not have to know which CLI produced the
trace.

Spawn discipline mirrors :class:`ClaudeDirectWorker`:

* ``asyncio.create_subprocess_exec`` (no shell, no PTY).
* Win32 ``CREATE_BREAKAWAY_FROM_JOB`` creationflags so the per-mission
  Windows Job Object can take ownership of the process tree.
* Strict ``env=...`` allowlist; explicitly omits ``OPENAI_API_KEY`` so
  the binary falls back to the ``~/.codex/auth.json`` OAuth path.
* Prompt passed on stdin -- avoids Windows command-line length cap.

Authentication: when the env does not carry ``OPENAI_API_KEY`` the
codex binary reads OAuth bearer + refresh tokens from
``~/.codex/auth.json`` in the user's profile. ``codex login`` (run
once interactively) is the canonical way to populate that file. We
NEVER write API keys here -- the user explicitly chose the ChatGPT
subscription path.
